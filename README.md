# AutoWa

AutoWa is an application designed to streamline vehicle service center interactions for both users and service center owners. Users can conveniently check their vehicle's service status, view invoices and service records, and book appointments directly through the app. Additionally, the desktop website provides service centers with tools to manage bookings efficiently.

## Features

- **User Dashboard:** Users can check the status of their vehicle, view invoices, and access service records.
- **Appointment Booking:** Users can book appointments by searching for a service center and filtering them by name or ratings.
- **Service Center Dashboard:** Service center owners can manage bookings and appointments through the desktop website.
